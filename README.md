# Draggable-Line
A single line on a transparent view. When a user touches any part of the screen, the line snaps to the user's finger and follows it as it drags the line around. When released, the line will snap to the nearest point. Meant for use with graphs.
Feel free to use this as a model for a custom draggable line in graphs.
